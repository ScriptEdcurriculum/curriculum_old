#ScriptEd Lesson 2: Working with Files and Directory Structures

**Goal: Learn about downloading, opening, editing, and saving files.**

**I'm keeping this kinda vague because different schools will have different environments**

##Using Folders

In an office, there are many drawers in a file cabinet. Each
drawer has a name. In each drawer, there are many folders
and each folder has a name. In each folder, there are many
sheets of paper.

A computer is like a giant file cabinet.

Discuss where students should save files, whether they have usb keys or are saving to a network drive, and any other relevant details..

###Create a new folder

Explain how to create a new folder.

###Have the students create a folder for each of the 11 ScriptEd Lessons.

##Download a File

1. Go to (need a scripted.org page here). Right click on the link that says Download Me and hit "Save Link As..."

2. Rename the file to "YOURNAME.html"

3. Make sure you are in your (network drive, usb key, etc.).

4. Save the file "YOURNAME.HTML" inside the folder "ScriptEd Lesson 2"

##Text Editors

A text editor is a computer program that allows you to edit plain text. As a web designer or developer, it's going to be the primary tool that you use to manipulate your work.

This is a little bit different than a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, or Google Docs.
You want to avoid word processors like these when you are coding because they add lots of special formatting that you can't see when you're typing.

One of the most useful features of a text editor is syntax highlighting. It means the editor will highlight certain words or types or syntax specific to a language. This way, if you forget to include an opening or closing quotation mark, you will quickly realize it because of the color of the text on your screen.  A text editor might also indicate mismatched parentheses or brackets by turning them red; if you have a closing brace with no corresponding opening one, the color will tell you that you made a syntax error somewhere.  NOTE: It may be necessary to explain "syntax" to students.

###Help students download and install notepad++ if they don't already have it. http://notepad-plus-plus.org

##Open a File

There are two ways to open a file:

###One Way

1. In your text editor, click "File", then click "Open".

2. Navigate through the folder structure to where your file is.

3. Click the "Open" button.

###Another Way

1. Navigate through the folder structure to where your file is. 

2. Right click on the file and select "Open With..."

3. Choose which program you want to use to open the file.

##Make changes to a file

1. Open YOURNAME.html in your web browser.

2. Open YOURNAME.html in your text editor.

3. Find where it say "TYPE YOUR NAME HERE"

4. Delete that text (ONLY THAT TEXT) and type your name.

5. Save the file.

6. Refresh the page in your web browser.
