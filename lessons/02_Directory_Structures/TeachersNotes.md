#ScriptEd Lesson 2: Working with Files and Directory Structures

**Goal: Learn about downloading, opening, editing and saving files.**

**I'm keeping this kinda vague because different school will have different environments**

##Using Folders

In an office, there are many drawers in a file cabinet. Each
drawer has a name. In each drawer, there are many folders
and each folder has a name. In each folder, there are many
sheets of paper.

A computer is like a giant file cabinet.

Discuss where student should save files, whether they have usb keys or are saving to network drive or whatever.
