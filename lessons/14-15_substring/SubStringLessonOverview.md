###ScriptEd Lessons 14-15
####String Manipulations Lesson Guide

Don't forget to have the students log their attendance at http://www.scripted.org/attendance !

Review: Students will have just completed their Madlibs / String Lesson.  This lesson will focus on some more advanced string manipulations.**

####Step 1 -- Group Brain Storm 
Review the last lesson with the students.  They learned how to read in a file and replace variables.

Ask students to generate other ideas on what they might be able to do with strings besides replacing one string for another (have one student act as a scribe at the board).

Possible brain storm ideas: 

-Get the first character of a word

-Get the last character of a word

####Step 2 -- Live Code (I do, We do)

Show students examples on the screen of string replacement methods.  Ask them to follow along in their text editors or on JSFiddle. Have  them do a few string manipulations on their names!


####Step 3 -- Student Project (You Do!)

Direct students to [this link](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum/blob/master/lessons/14-15_substring/student-template/substringstudentnotes.md) or display the link on the screen. They must create the program as directed in that link.
