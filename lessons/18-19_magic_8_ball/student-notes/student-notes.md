In this lesson we're going to create a Magic 8-Ball program.  It will answer any question the user asks!


Step 1 Question:
----------------
Prompt the user to ask a question and store whatever they enter in a variable. Can you remember how to change this from what you've learned about HTML forms? 

Step 2 Answers:
---------------
Now that the user has asked us a question, we need to provide an answer. Here are some examples of the type of answers your magic 8-ball could give. You can find more ideas online if you're having trouble thinking of some.

	Answer1: "Signs point to yes.";
	Answer2: "Reply hazy.  Try again.";
	Answer3: "Don't count on it.";

Step 3 Random Numbers and Accessing Arrays:
-------------------------------------------
Now using what we've learned so far in this class about random numbers and arrays to generate a random response for our magic 8-ball. Spend some time thinking about it, and then write the code into the getFortune function in 8ball.js.
